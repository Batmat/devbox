* PS1 add current docker daemon port/address if not localhost
* Extract vars directory from subrole(s). IMO does not make sense to have
  custom user configuration inside the role directory itself.

* Remove/factorize copy/pasted get-and-cache.yml

* Extract zshrc into dedicated chunks and then just source them all from a single dir.
* zshrc chunks:
** Create module to factor out the copy/pastes in tasks?
** Create var to share between role instead of hardcoding the chunks location
